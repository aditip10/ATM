ATM
As we know ATM machine performs multiple operations and those are:
1.Account Information
2.PIN Change

4.Withdrawal
5. Deposit
Now, What you need to do, You need to create a class of ATM and methods/functions is nothing but your operations that means your code will have 5 methods
One More important note, as you know if you enter wrong pin for three time it get block , that means you need to write a program in this way if I give wrong pin three times, Your account should get blocked. If you have any doubts, drop a comment or just text me on whats-app.
